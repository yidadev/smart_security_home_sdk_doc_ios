## iOS Version Adaptation

### iOS 13 Adaptation

#### Wi-Fi Permission Changed

  Since iOS 13, if you disable the permission to access location, `[[TuyaSmartActivator sharedInstance] currentWifiSSID]` will return false SSID. Here's the Apple email:

  ```
  As we announced at WWDC19, we're making changes to further protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized location tracking. Starting with iOS 13, the CNCopyCurrentNetworkInfo API will no longer return valid Wi-Fi SSID and BSSID information. Instead, the information returned by default will be: 
  
  SSID: "Wi-Fi" or "WLAN" (â€œWLAN" will be returned for the China SKU)
  BSSID: "00:00:00:00:00:00"
  ```

  1. Confirm the app has enabled the location permission.
  
2. When BSSID is "00:00:00:00:00:00", SSID is "Wi-Fi" or "WLAN" which is actually false and should be ignored. In this situation, let user input SSID manually is an option.
  
#### Bluetooth Permission Changed

If you have integrated TuyaSmartHomeKit with Tuya bluetooth device, please pay attention on "Bluetooth" permission. In iOS 13, every application will have a "Bluetooth" permission independent. When application first launched, user will be asked to switch on/off this permission.

  **If you are using Xcode 11 or later, please upgrade `TuyaSmartBLEMeshKit` to 2.12.47 or later, or bluetooth device may can't be searched.**

  When user disable this permission, bluetooth center will get status of `CBCentralManagerStateUnauthorized`, please suggest user turn it on.

### iOS 12 Adaptation

In iOS 12, `[[TuyaSmartActivator sharedInstance] currentWifiSSID]` can't get ssid.

- Xcode 10 should open access wifi information capability to get ssid. This can be found at:
Xcode -> [Project Name] -> Targets -> [Target Name] -> Capabilities -> Access WiFi Information -> ON
